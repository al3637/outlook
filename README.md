# What is in this folder
This folder contains several scripts all about Outlook. This is a side project that I worked on by myself at my last co-op all about managing and using Outlook. Below is a description of each of the files in this folder. The delete and count modules work, and I am still working on the send function. Make sure to have the Outlook app running while using these files and while running the files Outlook will not be responsive as it handles the requests.
# outlook.py
This file is the one to run first. It is the one that links the other modules in the folder and allows the user to run the various other files in the folder.
# delete.py
This file allows the user to specify as many users and folders as they would like emails deleted from. The user can specify the email of the person and any files that they would like emails from that user deleted from.
# count.py
This file allows the user to specify as many users and folders as they would like emails from certain users to be counted. It will go through each specified folder and user and count how many emails there are from them.
# send.py
This is a work in progress file that will allow the user to send emails directly from the command line without needing to use Outlook.
